Here's what's in my toolkit as of early 2026:

## Core Tools

- **Coding assistants**: Cursor IDE with AI-powered code completion and refactoring
- **Writing & documentation**: Claude for long-form content, ChatGPT for quick edits
- **Research & synthesis**: Perplexity for web research with citations
- **Workflow automation**: Custom agents built with LangChain and OpenAI APIs

## Models I Use

- **GPT-4**: For complex reasoning tasks and code generation
- **Claude Sonnet**: For nuanced writing and analysis
- **GPT-3.5-turbo**: For simpler, cost-effective tasks

## Current Focus Areas

1. **Agent development**: Building reliable, autonomous agents that can handle multi-step workflows
2. **RAG systems**: Creating knowledge bases that can answer questions about my work and processes
3. **Workflow optimization**: Identifying bottlenecks and automating repetitive tasks

This stack evolves constantly as new tools emerge and my needs change. I'll update this post periodically to reflect what's actually working in practice.
