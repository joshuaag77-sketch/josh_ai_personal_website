Measuring progress in AI-augmented work requires different metrics than traditional productivity tracking. Here's what I'm paying attention to:

## Quality Signals

- **Reduced iteration cycles**: How many rounds of feedback does it take to reach a satisfactory result?
- **Error rates**: Are AI-assisted outputs requiring fewer corrections over time?
- **Time to value**: How quickly can I go from idea to working prototype?

## Learning Indicators

- **Tool mastery**: Am I using AI tools more effectively, or just more frequently?
- **Workflow refinement**: Are my processes becoming more streamlined and repeatable?
- **Knowledge synthesis**: Can I connect insights across different domains more easily?

## Meta-Metrics

- **Autonomy**: How much can I delegate to AI agents while maintaining quality?
- **Creative leverage**: Is AI helping me explore ideas I wouldn't have considered otherwise?
- **System thinking**: Am I building reusable patterns, or just solving one-off problems?

## The Challenge

The hardest part is avoiding vanity metrics. More AI usage doesn't necessarily mean better outcomes. I'm trying to focus on outcomes that matter: better decisions, faster learning, and more impactful work.

This site itself is a progress signal—if I can build it quickly and maintain it easily, that's a win. If the future chatbot can accurately answer questions about my work, that's an even bigger win.
