Building with AI isn't just about using the latest tools—it's about fundamentally rethinking how we solve problems, create value, and scale our impact as professionals.

## The Opportunity

AI tools are reaching a maturity level where they can meaningfully augment human capabilities rather than just automate simple tasks. This creates unprecedented opportunities for:

- **Rapid prototyping**: Turning ideas into working prototypes faster than ever
- **Enhanced creativity**: Using AI as a thinking partner to explore solution spaces
- **Personalized automation**: Building workflows that adapt to individual needs

## What This Means for Me

As someone building in this space, I'm focused on:

1. **Understanding the boundaries**: Where does AI excel, and where does human judgment remain essential?
2. **Building practical workflows**: Creating systems that actually improve productivity, not just add complexity
3. **Sharing learnings**: Documenting what works, what doesn't, and why

This site is part of that journey—a place to track progress, share insights, and eventually enable others to learn from my experiences through an AI-powered knowledge base.
