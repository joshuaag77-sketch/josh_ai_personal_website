## Short Bio
Joshua Agarwal is a Facilities Engineer in Enbridge's New Energy Technologies organization, based in Calgary. He focuses on operational readiness, systems integration, and decision quality for first-of-a-kind low-carbon infrastructure. His work bridges engineering, operations, risk, and change management to move assets from design into safe, operable reality.

## Core Professional Focus
- Operational readiness and management of change
- Systems integration between engineering and operations
- Decision quality and structured tradeoffs under uncertainty
- Control systems, monitoring, and operator interfaces
- Risk, leak detection, and consequence thinking

## How He Works
- Frames ambiguous problems into explicit tradeoffs
- Surfaces readiness gaps early, before design lock-in
- Builds alignment without formal authority
- Emphasizes safety, operability, and long-term optionality

## Enbridge Contributions (Sanitized Summary)
From 2023 onward, Josh's contributions have increasingly centered on enterprise-level impact rather than isolated technical deliverables.

Key themes:
- Operational readiness for first-of-a-kind low-carbon assets, identifying gaps between traditional pipeline readiness processes and new fluids, new operating envelopes, and evolving regulatory expectations.
- Decision quality and alignment, reframing technical debates into tradeoffs across safety, operability, schedule risk, and long-term optionality.
- Cross-functional influence without formal authority, using clarity, preparation, and trust to align teams.
- Tooling and systems thinking, pushing beyond spreadsheet analysis toward more scalable, data-driven tooling.

## Technical & Domain Depth (Safe-to-Say)
- Operational readiness, training sequencing, documentation scope, and governance handoff
- Control systems: SCADA, PLCs, instrumentation, and operator HMI design for new operating behaviors
- Leak detection, consequence thinking, and monitoring tradeoffs (sensitivity vs false alarms)
- Awareness of transient behavior, thermodynamic sensitivity, and impurity impacts on operations

## Conferences & External Knowledge (Sanitized)
Josh has served as an internal knowledge-capture lead for external technical conferences, translating dense technical content into Enbridge-relevant implications.

Themes covered:
- Hydrogen production and electrolyzer technologies
- Carbon management and CCS operations
- Ammonia and alternative energy carriers
- Safety, certification, and market credibility frameworks

Common insights emphasized:
- Technology maturity often lags market narratives
- Certification and standards matter as much as chemistry
- Safety and operability are the true bottlenecks to scale
- Many clean energy projects fail due to organizational and regulatory misalignment, not physics

## Leadership Philosophy
- Discipline, integrity, adaptability, and long-term thinking
- Explicit tradeoffs and clear decision rights
- Sequencing actions to preserve optionality

## MBA Narrative (High-Level)
Josh pursued engineering to build technical credibility, then recognized that many clean-energy projects stall due to risk tolerance, capital allocation, and stakeholder misalignment. An MBA is viewed as a bridge to complement technical skills with finance, strategy, and portfolio management. Long-term, he aspires to help build a climate infrastructure platform that scales low-carbon technologies faster by aligning capital, risk, and execution.

## Young Professionals in Energy (YPE) Leadership
Josh played a significant leadership role in YPE, aligning a board with divergent priorities and improving execution. He helped define clearer themes for programming, explicit budget ownership, and decision rights. The chapter delivered a strong year with twelve events, new sponsors, and a sold-out flagship event. He was unanimously elected as 2026 President of YPE.

## Avatar (Entrepreneurial Clean-Tech Initiative)
Avatar is an early-stage, hydrogen-focused clean-tech venture concept referenced in Josh's MBA materials. It reflects his interest in infrastructure-scale climate solutions and his view that execution, governance, and capital discipline are as important as technology innovation. Avatar is formative in his career arc, helping clarify his goal of building a climate infrastructure platform.

## Kiewit (Earlier Career Experience)
Josh has experience with Kiewit, which adds large-project engineering exposure and reinforces his focus on real-world execution and operational constraints.

## Safe Summary (Chatbot)
Joshua Agarwal is a Facilities Engineer in Enbridge's NET group who focuses on operational readiness, systems integration, and decision quality for new low-carbon energy infrastructure. He bridges engineering, operations, and risk to help first-of-a-kind assets move safely from design into operation.
